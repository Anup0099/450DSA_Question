// You are given a positive integer n

// Find any permutation p
// of length n such that the sum lcm(1,p1)+lcm(2,p2)+â€¦+lcm(n,pn)

// is as large as possible.

// Here lcm(x,y)
// denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers x and y

// .

// A permutation is an array consisting of n
// distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array) and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).
