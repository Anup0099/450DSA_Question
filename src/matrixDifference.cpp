// For a square matrix of integers of size n×n, let's define its beauty as follows: for each pair of side-adjacent elements x and y, write out the number |x−y|, and then find the number of different numbers among them.

// For example, for the matrix (1432) the numbers we consider are |1−3|=2, |1−4|=3, |3−2|=1 and |4−2|=2; there are 3 different numbers among them (2, 3 and 1), which means that its beauty is equal to 3.

// You are given an integer n. You have to find a matrix of size n×n, where each integer from 1 to n2 occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices.

// Input
// The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤49) – the number of test cases.

// The first (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer n (2≤n≤50).

// Output
// For each test case, print n rows of n integers — a matrix of integers of size n×n, where each number from 1 to n2 occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
