    why hashmap is used ?
    to find the frequencies in an array
    brute force to find to find the frequencies 
    it goes to linear iteration if we use a for loop o(qxn) time complexity
    time complexity will be very large suppose array is given 10^5 
    time complexity 10^8 takes approx take 1 sec 
    time complexity 10^10 takes approx take 100 sec
     this is why hashing comes in pplace pre storing and fetching

    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[i]==1){
            count++;
        }
    } 
}
